# Prototype to Performance
## Envisioning An Experience For Everyone

 ## From Pixels To A Prototype
  ### Finding A Purpose for our Prototype

### Design Taxonomy
  * Crowd Participation
    * Increased number of users enhances or creates an increased physical, emotional, media/computational response.  
       
### Area of Focus
  * Media Architecture
    * Computational display systems incorporated into the physical landscape including screens, lights, projection mapping and tracking.
    
### Sensory Environment:
  * Visual Graphic
    * 2D physical imaging technologies that use pigment or found objewcts, including priting, painting and mixed media.  
  * Visual: Light
    * Eminating or luminating a light source.
  * Visual: Distortion
    * Intentionally or randomly affecting the pattern of a series or sequence or light, pixels or images.  
  * Visual: Projection
    * Casting or throwing light from a source to a surface.  
  * Sound: Distortion / Generation 
    * Intentionally or randomly affecting the pattern of, or creating an audio wave or series.  
    
### BodyStorming
  * Interactive Environments
    * The idea is to have multiple controllers as "keys" in a walking exhibit or installation.  Whenever the user presses the button on their microcontroller it changes the environment around them, but not for everyone else.  
  * Projection Mapping
    * A projection mapped visual onto the ground.  When users walk onto the projection their position is tracked.  Pressing a button controls an aspect of the projection.  Could require multiple people.  
  * Crowd Generated Music/Sound
    * A collective crowd generated
